## Hi, I’m Moheed Dar

I am a **Full Stack Web Developer** with experience in building **scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications**. I work across both **frontend and backend**, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and real-world problem solving.

I have hands-on experience with **modern JavaScript frameworks**, backend APIs, authentication systems, and real-time features. I enjoy developing complete systems rather than isolated features and continuously work on improving my technical skills.
